# Hi there! 🧐




- I'm currently working on two projects as personal hobbies: [create-API](https://github.com/pecampelo/create-api) and [whatsapp-to-excel](https://github.com/pecampelo/whatsapp-to-excel) 😊
- I'm currently studying Typescript, Node, PostgreSQL and a course named [JStack](https://www.jstack.com.br) made by a developer named [Mateus Silva](https://www.github.com/maateusilva).

- My main goal is to work as a back-end developer in little time. 🎩
